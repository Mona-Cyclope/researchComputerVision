# Experiment 0

Acceleration for neural networks using [stochastic] length.
A simple example could be the denoising of a simple signal.

## Experiment 00

At first we design a simple nn that denoises a 1d signal this will make prooving some properties much simpler.

## Experiment 01

A seond design is to test a pyramid feature extractor. The idea is to test wheter the network needs the whole pyramidal informations at all times.
The idea is that for small scale objects it should not be needed.
